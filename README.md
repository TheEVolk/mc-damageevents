# DamageEvent minecraft fabric mod

This small client mod runs a websocket server on port 8220 and sends a hit message there every time a player takes damage.

This is my first minecraft mod

## Why
This is part of my project to fully immerse myself in the world of the game. When I take damage, my arduino device hits me with a weak current.
